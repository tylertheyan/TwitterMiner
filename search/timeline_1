Be there for anyone that needs help!#BellLetsTalk People have come out of the closet about mental health. Way to go. I lost my brother to suicide in 1983.  There was no help.@Bell_LetsTalk It is great to be able to say I got out of the dark hole and live my life.  Knowing that it could happen again.

Yes it is a disease.#BellLetsTalk I helped a co worker that didn't realize she was suffering from depression and even her family had no idea.  But I helped her#BellLetsTalk It is so hard to describe what depression feels like to someone who has never been there.

Now I need you, and you're not around.That "Babe, i'm sick... so don't kiss me." ... "Fuck it, we'll just be sick together." type of relationship &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;every time she laughsshe hopes hes watchinghoping that he will fall for her smile just as hard as she fellfor hisHe smiled and all I could think was 'oh shit'.Everything takes time. You have to lose your pride. You have to lose your mind just to find your peace of mind. You gotta trust the signs.if i said i got u, i got uLowkey miss youHighkey know I'm better than thisShe was playing with me then but she waiting nowStop checking on people, who aren't checking for you.im only down 4 uyou didn't reply but i got your messagei don't understand how ppl are ok with themselves knowing they emotionally destroyed someonewe all want to be a somebody to someoneSeeing your EX downgrade &gt;&gt;&gt; Best feeling!depression is when your mind and heart stop loving each other but still eat at the same dinner table every nightkeep it real with me that's all I askholy shit i miss yousometimes the grass is greener on the other side of the fence because it's fake.mixed signals are so annoying like do you fucking want me or not?????if you lucky enough to get a second chance, don't waste that shiti used to think you were the best thing to come into my life, but i was wrongit's better to have nobody than to have someone who is half there, or doesn't want to be there at allEverything will fall into place, be patient.not giving a fuck is better than revengeI'd much rather FaceTime or talk on the phone with someone i really like. Texting just ain't gonna cut it.kinda want a relationship kinda dont ever want to give someone the power to hurt meit's so sad how people always promise they'll fix the problems you call them out on, but they never dofuck u for making me happy and then just turning around and leavingdo you ever miss certain friends but you don't even wanna hit them up anymore because things aren't the samethat respect shit goes both waysBe confident. Avoid small talk. Embrace conversation. Take chances. Ask questions. Make mistakes. Learn. Know your worth. Love true. SmilStay around people who look more like your future.Don't compare your progress with that of others. We all need our own time to travel our own distance.am I a bad person for wishing you the best but still hoping that you would be sad without me?People will notice the change in your attitude towards them, but won't notice their behavior that made you change.WHY DO I DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME I'M SO STUPIDyou stabbed me a thousand times and then acted like you were the one bleedingIf u got something good going don't tell nobody.Don't treat the right person wrongme: i'm not a jealous person me 5 mins later: who is thisi could look into your eyesuntil the sun comes upwe try to hide our feelings, but we forget that our eyes speakremind them what they lostdon't sugar coat shit for me, just tell me whats upwhen you mind your own business there are never any issues.it always sucks going from non stop conversations to one word repliesmy talents include not sleeping at nightimma see = i'm not comingif you... choose... to leave someone's life... stay out... don't continuously pop in and outyou can ignore me for 5 days and ill still reply in .05 seconds lmao i hate myselfdo em how they do youAppreciate everything, regret nothing.I appreciate honesty over everything. If you tell me what it is upfront and give me the option to take it or leave it, I respect thatif someone really wants to see you, they'll find a reason, they'll find a way, and they'll make the effortfind someone that knows how to calm your stormspeople will push you to your limits, and when you finally explode and fight back, suddenly you're the bad personStunt on anyone who didn't see potential in youHaving anxiety is the most silently painful experience. It makes no sense and you sit there alone and suffer for an unknown reason.do you ever have those people that just annoy you so much and you dont even know why but they just infuriate youIf someone makes an effort to stay and be there for you no matter how fucked up you are, those are truly the ones you need in your lifejust want someone who's 100% down for me.You can't just come into someones life, make them feel special, and then leave.i want you alllllllllllllllll tooooooo myssselffffffffffffcan't hang around people who have no goals or ambitionswe're not the same person we were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago. we're constantly changing, experiences don't stop. that's life.what hurts most is when the only thing that makes you happy fails youdo your own thing without worrying or hating on anyonejust b happythey hate thati don't even care about losing people anymore cause everyone leaves anywaysi went thru all the madness so ain't a soul alive out there that can hurt medo u ever look at someone and just pray to god you never have to lose themThe less you care, the happier you will be.I hate going an entire day without talking to you.everyone in life will hurt you, you just have to chose the ones worth suffering for and when that suffering is enoughoh sorry, i forgot, i only exist when you need somethingim missing half of me when we're apartNo, No, I get it. You can ignore me all the time, but if I ignore you, It's a big deal.It's okay if u did me dirty I'm not gonna go outta my way to hurt u. God got u.my weakness is that i care too muchforgive, yes. forget, nevermy main goal right now is to be happyu don't gotta be perfect just keep it realThe best conversations are when nothing is being forced, just flows.stop going out your way for people who don't even fuck with you, use that energy somewhere elseno one texts me but im always on my phone lolnothing but fake smiles and bottled up emotionsdon't sleep on anyone who has their best interest in youkeep it real or keep your distanceWhen you have a good heart: You help too much. You trust too much. You give too much. You love too much &amp; it always seems you hurt the most.die with memories, not dreams!somewhere between "fuck you" and "love me".you hardly smoke but you wanna smoke my drugsur all i think about but i will never tell ubut, you're still a bitch to mepsychotic jealous girls are winninglet's pretend i'm ok let's pretend i don't miss you every second of every daywhy do ppl think its ok to waste my timebein called baby or babe by the right person is like heaven tbhi get jealous over you and you're not even mine.real friends are a blessingshowed a side of myself to some who didn’t deserve to know me like that.fav if you're still up 🌴i'm obsessed with my space &amp; alone time so if i wanna spend time with you or talk to you consistently, just know you're speciali wish the good moments lasted foreverit's true that being alone and lonely are two completely different things but they are one heck of a painful combinationhonestly, fuck growing up.fuck ur bad vibeshave you ever texted someone so much that you kinda adapt to the way they texttbh only got like 2-3 friendslong car rides with good music &gt;&gt;&gt;i need someone who needs me. because my problem is that i always need someone, but then they end up leaving because no one ever needs me...you can't live a positive life with a negative mind.im a really chill person tbh just don't push itmy thoughts are so much deeper at night*still uses pinky promises as a legitimate foundation of trust*love is when you take away the feeling, the passion and the romance of a relationship and find out you still care for that personhighkey only want youjust trying to get ahead from where i am nowyou gotta go through shit to understand shit.i want something unexpectedly good to happen right now."you're so quiet" nah fam i talk. just not to you.you're a bad idea but i like bad ideasi don't wanna feel anything anymorei fear wasting my time, not commitmenti want you, but the question is do you want me?i'm the type of person that one thing can change my mood completely and i can go from confident to insecure in a matter of seconds.so i guess it ends here, we'll go our separate ways and hope that we'll see each other somewhere in the futureit's pretty ironic how people get mad when you treat them the same way they treat youdon't hit me up when it's good for you.don't be afraid of losing people, be afraid of losing yourself trying not to lose someone else.always marry a girl who's confident enough to slap her own assyou wanna know how i got these scars, i ripped every last piece of you out of my smile..it's all fun and games till someone catches feelingsi don't want a relationship, i just want more clothes.somewhere between i care too much and not caring at allforever putting in 100% and getting 5% backi just want to mean something to somebody, but it hurts so much knowing that i’ll never be anything to anybody..nothing worth having comes easyyou feel so lonely and you start to cry but nobody understands.. nobody sees just how broken you really are.my hotline don't bling, ring, or ding.sometimes, good things fall apart so better things can fall together.most painful thing ever is having feelings for someone you can't be with.she's the type of girl you'll regret losing.don't fall in love. fall off a bridge, it hurts lessi hate that feeling of not being wanted by the person you want to be wanted by the mosti don't fear commitment, i fear wasting my time.inhale the good shit, exhale the bullshit.i don't care about rumors, i know what i've said and donei knew you were going to break my heart, but a part of me really hoped you wouldn't.life is beautiful when you learn to see the good in everything instead of seeing the flawsshe’s the kind of girl you meet when you're too young, and you messed up because there’s too much living to do. only to find she's the one.everything about you is addicting as fuckalways remember that god will never take anything away from you without the intention of replacing it with something better.i'm that person who falls apart but tries to keep everyone else togetheri love how you can make me laugh even when i'm not in the mood to smilesometimes you gotta let go and see what comes backlife is too short to waste time hating anyonethere’s so much i wanna say but nah.time changes people.bring your body baby i can bring you fameeveryone tells you that you deserve better, but no one is willing to give it to you.happiness is a choicedo you think the universe fights for souls to be together? some things are too strange and strong to be coincidences.y'all gonna hate me when i get my shit togetherthe saddest people try their best to make people happy. they know what it’s like to feel worthless, they don’t want anyone to feel that.i can switch from i can't live without you to who tf are you in secondsi need a hug and six months of sleepdon't let a bitch phase youif i lived with bae i would never use my phonei get so jealous, but idgaf.rather have a real conversation than textquit looking for happiness in the same place you lost ithigh on anxietystop hurting people who love you, because one day you'll look around and realize you have no one to comfort you when you're cryingthe worst feeling is when you find out you didn't mean as much to someone as you thought you did and you look so stupid for caring too much.its scary how fast you can lose someone you lovei wanna lose myself between your legs, i wanna make your body shakeher attitude kinda savage but her heart is goldalcohol will only make a person cheat if they’d considered doing it while sober. being drunk changes your behavior, not your moralsthings im unsure of: everythingi hate when u can feel things slowly changingim too chill for all the drama and bullshiti want to emphasize the importance of surrounding yourself with people who genuinely care about you and feel proud to have you existRT @broken: don't ever compare me to someone elseRT @DailyIaugh: Buying a new car off craigslist be like😂 https://t.co/GdKB2ptFdIRT @noheartfound: lol @ the boys that lost that one girl who was for &amp; all about them but now they gotta watch her love another guy who act…RT @visualgasm: New York https://t.co/dLkllhl9WuRT @ifeelglorious: don't give me 20% when i give you 80%RT @kyIiefeed: you ever just be mad at ya self for not moving forward and being better in your lifeRT @ExpIorative: Exploring Utah https://t.co/3OwQRBcG5mRT @ArtDaiIy: https://t.co/83mps3aBKiRT @ExpIorative: Abu Dhabi, UAE 🇦🇪 https://t.co/r6AclFlRo3RT @brysontlIler: i need to stop caring about people that don't care about meRT @RAPBlBLE: ‘STILL THINK IM NOTHING’ 🔥🔥🔥 @50cent https://t.co/VGyUqPSGD2RT @BestFitsDaiIy: FOG https://t.co/R9mFSPXtu3RT @buzkilI: what anxiety feels like https://t.co/RKJbu0GBDORT @buzkilI: haven't felt my worth in so longRT @moviepoetic: james franco in freaks and geeks (1999-2000) https://t.co/zPAkXybnoaRT @spaceveins: brand new phone case designs available at https://t.co/ZUAlPFm0H3 ✨ https://t.co/BuMM5KfrhySo what I got a tattoo at 14, bitch I was wearing big earrings in 3rd grade, catch me ousside https://t.co/6A6wIWt9OlThis really fucked me up https://t.co/2nlFJPhs9KLOVE MY MOM https://t.co/fK8Y1kCncETHIS NEEDS TO GO VIRAL https://t.co/XBLsQSRUbpdon't try me https://t.co/WRJ972I0SYThink i wont find you ?
